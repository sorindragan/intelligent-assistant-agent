On Monday, I am meeting Mark.
He is my best friend.
He and I will buy sugar, flour, backing soda, milk, and chocolate from Jerry's Supermarket.
I will bring my old camera.
White chocolate is the secret ingredient for the cake.
White chocolate is more expensive than dark chocolate.
The secret ingredient for the cake is white chocolate.

I like blue cats and white dogs.
A computer is an intelligent machine.
I bought sugar from the store.
Mark went to the zoo in the afternoon.
The red car is faster than the blue car.
